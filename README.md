# Linear-Regression-with-Numpy
Although linear regression is available in many python packages that can be used easily by importing those packages, this repo is implemented Linear regression in NumPy just to help people understand the code flow behind it.

To learn more in detail read the [Notebook](https://github.com/nishanthgandhidoss/Linear-Regression-with-Numpy/blob/master/Regression_Nishanth_Gandhidoss.ipynb)

You can see the code within the numpy_regressor that consists of OOP implementation of regression. And __init__.py file uses those classes to compute regression [Airfoil dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise). Below a least mean square error visualization for this data on cross validation to choose the hyperparameters for the model such as basis function and lamda for linear closed function.
